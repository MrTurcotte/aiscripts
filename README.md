## Gentoo0
*Prompt* 
"I need a bash script that 
- creates a gpt partition table on a usb drive
- creates a 1GB EFI partition on the usb drive
- creates an ext4 partition using the rest of the space on the usb drive
- properly formats the two partitions on the usb drive
- installs Gentoo to the usb drive with O3 optimizations and March=native

The drive is /dev/sda but the fstab should use the UUID of the drive's partitions."

## Gentoo1
*Prompt*
"It needs to use SystemD boot, not grub."

## Gentoo2
*Prompt*
"Please make a new script with just the Gentoo installation part. Expand on this part to make it complete."
